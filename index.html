				<span>•	Stage 1 of the Australian Synchrotron is the 'Electron Gun.' The electron gun, which is located near the centre of the synchrotron, and is used to fire the electrons into the synchrotron. Electrons are gathered from a "thin tungsten wire  that is heated by a current to about 1000 degrees Celsius" and then are attracted out of the wire with by 120 kilo volts (Reference 2). At this point, the beam of electrons are at 59% of the speed of light, and are moved into Stage 2.<br></br>
•	Stage 2 of the Australian Synchrotron is the 'Linear Accelerator' or 'LINAC' for short. In this stage, the electron beam is bought to "an energy of 100 MeV over a distance of 10 metres" This accelerates the beam of electrons to a speed of "99.995% of the speed of light". The electrons are then moved into stage 3 of the synchrotron.<br></br>
•	Stage 3 of the Australian Synchrotron  is the Booster Ring. In this stage, the electrons are sped up to 3,000 MeV through the use of accelerators. However, the electrons only increase in speed slightly, and instead largely increases in mass due relativity. The electrons are now travelling at 99.999994% of the speed of light, and the electrons move into Stage 4.<br></br>
•	Stage 4 of the Australian Synchrotron is the Storage Ring. In this stage, electrons are sent around the 216 metre circumference storage ring, which is made up of "13 short straight-line sections". As the electrons are in the ring, they are guided around it by a series of magnets. When the electrons are being deflected through the magnetic fields, "they give off electromagnetic radiation so that at each bending magnet a beam of synchrotron light is produced.". This beam of synchrotron light is then sent in a forward direction towards one of the Beamlines (annotation 5 in pictures), which then uses the synchrotron radiation for a variety of different tests. Most beamlines are set up differently for different tests, and require different specific frequency ranges for the tests. This frequency is "selected by a monochromator” which means that only a specific frequency ends up hitting the target at the end of the beam line. These beams then end up at the End-stations, who use it for various experiments.<br></br>
