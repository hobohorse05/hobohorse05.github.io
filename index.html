				<span>•	Stage 1 of the Australian Synchrotron is the 'Electron Gun.' The electron gun, which is located near the centre of the synchrotron, and is used to fire the electrons into the synchrotron. Electrons are gathered from a "thin tungsten wire  that is heated by a current to about 1000 degrees Celsius" and then are attracted out of the wire with by 120 kilo volts (Reference 2). At this point, the beam of electrons are at 59% of the speed of light, and are moved into Stage 2.<br></br>
•	Stage 2 of the Australian Synchrotron is the 'Linear Accelerator' or 'LINAC' for short. In this stage, the electron beam is bought to "an energy of 100 MeV over a distance of 10 metres" This accelerates the beam of electrons to a speed of "99.995% of the speed of light". The electrons are then moved into stage 3 of the synchrotron.<br></br>
•	Stage 3 of the Australian Synchrotron  is the Booster Ring. In this stage, the electrons are sped up to 3,000 MeV through the use of accelerators. However, the electrons only increase in speed slightly, and instead largely increases in mass due relativity. The electrons are now travelling at 99.999994% of the speed of light, and the electrons move into Stage 4.<br></br>
•	Stage 4 of the Australian Synchrotron is the Storage Ring. In this stage, electrons are sent around the 216 metre circumference storage ring, which is made up of "13 short straight-line sections". As the electrons are in the ring, they are guided around it by a series of magnets. When the electrons are being deflected through the magnetic fields, "they give off electromagnetic radiation so that at each bending magnet a beam of synchrotron light is produced.". This beam of synchrotron light is then sent in a forward direction towards one of the Beamlines (annotation 5 in pictures), which then uses the synchrotron radiation for a variety of different tests. Most beamlines are set up differently for different tests, and require different specific frequency ranges for the tests. This frequency is "selected by a monochromator” which means that only a specific frequency ends up hitting the target at the end of the beam line. These beams then end up at the End-stations, who use it for various experiments.<br></br>

				<span><br>Particle accelerators that produce synchrotron light are mainly synchrotrons, Synchrotron light can be used to emulate regular light, infrared light, or X-rays, synchrotron light is used in many different fields of science and is said that the uses of it is only limited by our imagination. Synchrotron light is used in experiments to devise new cancer therapies, it is used to compare viruses, it can allow detailed analysis and modelling of strain, cracks, and corrosion in the study of materials during production processing, in the field of environmental science it is used in high resolution study of ultra-dilute substances, the identification of species, and the ability to track pollutants as they move in the environment, synchrotron light can also be used to study ancient samples of archaeology. Particle accelerators that collide particles are similar to ones that produce synchrotron light however particle colliders accelerate one particle into another in order to observe the effects of their Collison. These collisions are used mainly in order to study particle physics through the reactions of certain particles as they collide and observing their results, for example the Large Hadron Collider smashes protons together in order to observe what is contained within the protons. </span>

				<span>Synchrotron radiation is emitted as photons, that is emitted "in a narrow cone in the forward direction, at a tangent to the electron's orbit" 
Spectrum: The spectrum of synchrotron radiation usually shows up as X-rays. However, radiation can be produced across the electromagnetic spectrum, starting at infra-red going upwards. Additionally, the spectrum is continuous, meaning that when shown on a graph there is no missing frequencies. As synchrotron radiation can show up as x-rays, it means the two are quite similar. However, x-rays have spikes in intensity instead of a continuous frequency.  Synchrotron radiation differs from laser light as laser have the ability to have high temporal coherence. This allows them to have light that is emitted with a very narrow spectrum, meaning they can emit one colour of light. This differs from synchrotron light, which has the capacity to show up broadly on the spectrum. <br> </br>Brightness: The intensity of the light is far more severe than x-ray tubes, with x-ray tubes showing up at 108 to 1010 photons per second and synchrotron light showing up at 1015 photons per second. The brightness of synchrotron light can appear up to hundreds of thousands times greater than the brightness of the sun. Recently, laser light brightness has reached a new high, as brightness of the brightest laser is "one billion times greater than the surface of the sun" <br></br>
Divergence: As it travels down the beamline, the beam of radiation spreads out like a cone. However, the cone's angle is "less than one thousandth of a degree". When compared to the divergence of laser light and x-ray tubes, it is narrower than both, and laser light is narrow, with x-ray tubes having a wide divergence. <br></br>
